# CryptoSolvers Lab

CryptoSolvers is a group of researchers across several univerisities that apply techniques within computational logic to cryptography.

We follow a three phased approach:
- Map a security property from a computational definition to a symbolic security equivalent
- Apply symbolic techniques such as term rewriting and unification to verify the symbolic security property
- Automatically synthesize cryptosystems that satisfy the security property

We're the primary developers of [CryptoSolve](https://github.com/CryptoSolvers/CryptoSolve) a library for verifying and synthesizing modes of operations
as well as a general tool for working with unification and term rewriting.
